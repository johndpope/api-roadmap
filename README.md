# api-roadmap
Documentation and resources about the next version of the TransferWise API.

The repositiory is intended to be a place to store information and promote discussion around the future of the TransferWise API, creating a feedback channel between partners and ourselves. Partners - before you make comments or open PRs please remember this repository is public and as such you may inadvernatnly allow people to see we are working together before our partnership is announced. Please keep communication private in cases where partnerships are still secret.

Currently v2 of the API is in the design phase and once published here will be available to be viewed and discussed.
